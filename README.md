plural-message-migration
========================

This tool provides [Plural Message Migration](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules#TOC-Plural-Message-Migration) for [Gettext PO files](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html). This tool was specifically implemented to migrate a Launchpad translation project to Transifex and was necessary since Transifex does not support custom plural forms, recently migrated to newer [plural forms](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html), and does not permit converting/uploading files in an older plural form version.
